### Start the application

controller.exe show alphabet count
> 27

## Scenarios
Any scenario that would be worth pointing out

### Invalid output
When using `controller.exe show alphabet count` it does not account for special letters like `ü,ä,ö,ß`  
You would have to change the lanugage settings using `controller.exe change alphabet lang=german`
